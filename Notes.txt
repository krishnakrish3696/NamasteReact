Episode 1:

When you creating element using React.createElement() => It will create as js object.
ReactElement (Object) => HTML (Bowser Understand) 
ReactDom.createRoot() => Create the dom 
Const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render() => this render convert the object html tag which browser can understand.

During  the render if we already have any tag inside the root that will replace when root.render().


Episode 2:

NPM: NPM does not have any obervation but in website they will show some random stuff. They have seprate repo for that.
Pakage.json is configuration for NPM.

Most important package in project?
     Bundler.

what is bundler ? 
    bundler in React is a tool that allows developers to package their code into a single file or bundle.
 
There are two types of dependencies / packages.
    * Dev Dependency
        It is generely required for devlopment phase.
    * Normal Dependency
        It is used oin production also.

For installing the parcel we are using the code 
    * npm install -D parcel
       -D refers we are installing parcel as devlopment Dependency.

What's the difference between tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json?

    ~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will automatically update you to all future patch versions 
    that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases 
    from 1.2.3 to < 1.3.0.

    ^version “Compatible with version”, will automatically update you to all future minor/patch versions 
    that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases 
    from 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0.

Package.lock.Json vs Packgae.Json?

    * Package.lock.json track the exacte version of the all the Dependency which is installed in the machine.
    * package.json file contains the list of dependencies and scripts in a project

Node Modules?

    * In the all the web project node Modules are very heavy basically it fetch the all the code of all the dependencies
then we can use that.
    * A transitive dependency in computer science refers to a functional dependency pattern where the value of one attribute 
    is determined by another attribute, which in turn is determined by a third attribute. This creates a chain of dependencies, 
    similar to the transitive property in mathematics.

Npx -> package executer.
    Npx any packagename that will execute the package.
Npx -> execute the package ex: npx parcel index.html
